# Changelog

Currently, GlyTrait is in development and no stable version has been released yet. 
The following is a list of changes that have been made to the project.

## v2.0.0

**Changed**:

- `Experiment` class and CLI can accept a meta-property table instead of a 
  glycan structure or composition file. 
  This allows further cumstomization of the trait calculation.
  To accommodate the change, the second argument of CLI ("glycan-file") is
  now an option, and another "mp-file" option was added.
  See README for details.

**Removed**:

- The `input_data` argument from `Experiment` was removed.
- The `Experiment.extract_meta_properties` method was removed.
  Meta-property table is extracted from glycan structures or compositions
  automatically after `Experiment` initialization.
- `load_data` and `GlyTraitInputData` were removed. 

## v0.1.7

**Fixed:**

- Fix the bug that type checks failed when the abundance data type is integer.

## v0.1.6

**Changed:**

- The `Experiment` class now can be initialized from file paths directly.
  The old way of initializing from a `GlyTraitInputData` instance could be done
  by the keyword argument: `Experiment(input_data=input_data)`.
- The file format instructions in the Streamlit app are updated to be more clear.

## v0.1.5

**Added:**

- A new `try_formulas` method for `Experiment`. 
  This method returned the calculated derived trait DataFrame directly based on 
  given formula expressions.
  It might be useful for glycomics EDA.
- Example data are added to the Streamlit app.

**Changed:**

- `Experiment.extract_meta_properties` method was removed for less confusion to users.
  Calling `Experiment.preprocess` will automatically extract meta properties.

## v0.1.4

**Added:**

- Sialic acid linkage configuration in the Streamlit app.
- A spinner is shown now when the Streamlit app is running.

**Fixed:**

- Fix the bug that the "mode" configuration was ignored by the Streamlit app.

## v0.1.3

**Added:**

- The Streamlit app!
- A new method for the `Experiment` class: `Experiment.run_workflow()`.

## v0.1.2

**Added:**

- `Experiment` class is added as the new api of GlyTrait, instead of the old `GlyTrait`. 
  This might be part of the python package api in the future.

**Changed:**

- The formula file format is much simpler: any non-blank lines not starting with
  "#" will be parsed as a formula. 
  The formula descriptions are converted into comments (starting with "#").
- `GlyTraitInputData` now checks the validity of data.
  This allows dynamic change the input data after a `GlyTraitInputData` instance
  is created.

**Removed:**

- `GlyTrait` class is removed.

## v0.1.1

**Changed:**

- When provided a custom formula file, the built-in formula file is no longer used.

## v0.1.0

Initial release of GlyTrait.
